[ðŸ‘€ Look at the demo](https://sample-one-shot-payment.vercel.app/)

## Important notes
This is not a production ready e-shop, this is a showcase to describe the technical integration among an external system and XPAY API.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev -- --https
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:
```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with 
```

```

### Updating theme and regenerate css

When modifying the theme folder, you need to regenerate the css style with

```bash

```
After that, you're ready to go.

## Configuring
### Server
You can change your api key by changing the following file
```
src/lib/server/config.server.js
